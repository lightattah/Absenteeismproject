# Absenteeism Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains the necessary files for running an absenteeism prediction model. It includes preprocessing of the data, model training using logistic regression, and the resulting predictions.

## Files Description

- `Absenteeism_data.csv` - This CSV file contains the initial raw data used in the absenteeism analysis. It includes various features related to employee absenteeism.

- `Absenteeism Project - Preprocessing.ipynb` - A Jupyter notebook that details the preprocessing steps applied to the raw data. This includes cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for modeling.

- `Absenteeism Project - Logistic Regression_with_comments.ipynb` - This Jupyter notebook contains the logistic regression model used to predict absenteeism. It includes comments explaining each step of the model building process.

- `Absenteeism_predictions.csv` - The output file containing the predictions made by the logistic regression model. It lists the predicted probabilities of absenteeism for each instance in the dataset.

## Usage

To run the notebooks, you will need Jupyter installed on your machine:

1. Install Jupyter, if you haven't already:
   ```
   pip install jupyter
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open the `.ipynb` files and execute the cells sequentially to view the process and results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
